# THINK 2018 - Element Classification Lab!

## Overview
**Watson Compare and Comply:** _Element Classification_ makes it possible to rapidly parse through governing documents to convert, identify, & classify elements of importance. Using state of the art Natural Language Processing, party (who it refers to), nature (the type of element), & category (specific class) are extracted from elements of a document.

**Watson Compare and Comply:** _Element Classification_ is designed to provide:
- Natural Language Understanding of Contracts and Regulatory documents
- The ability to convert programmatic PDF to annotated JSON
- Identification of legal Entities and Categories that align with subject matter expertise
	
**Watson Compare and Comply:** _Element Classification_ brings together a functionally rich set of automated Watson APIs to convert programmatic PDFs into a structured HTML format. This allows a user to identify: sections, lists (numbered and bulleted), footnotes, and tables from a document, converting these items into a structured format for further processing. In addition, classification of this structured output is annotated and with labeled elements, types and categories and surfaced to the user in a JSON format. 

**Watson Compare and Comply:** _Element Classification_ securely transmits your data performing encryption in flight and at rest. For information about IBM Cloud security, see theIBM Cloud Service Description.
